Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
-----------------------------------------------------

### Running the script

To run the script in `run_analysis.R`, you should have downloaded the data set
from [this link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
and unpacked it in the same folder where the script is. When unpacking, make
sure that a folder named `UCI HAR Dataset` is created, where the data set
files reside.

You will have the following folder structure:

    |-- CodeBook.md
    |-- README.md
    |-- run_analysis.R
    |-- UCI HAR Dataset
    |   |-- activity_labels.txt
    |   |-- features.txt
    |   |-- features_info.txt
    |   |-- README.txt
    |   |-- test
    |   |   |-- Inertial Signals
    |   |   |   |-- body_acc_x_test.txt
    |   |   |   |-- body_acc_y_test.txt
    |   |   |   |-- body_acc_z_test.txt
    |   |   |   |-- body_gyro_x_test.txt
    |   |   |   |-- body_gyro_y_test.txt
